# Zoom Tab Close

When joining a Zoom meeting via a browser click, the desktop app is launched. The opened tab will redirect to a "status=success" URL when the desktop app successfully joins, leaving behind an open browser tab you have to close.

This addon closes those tabs automatically as soon as they redirect to "status=success"

I am not a seasoned addon dev.. Please fork it, fix it, PR it.

## Changelog

v1.2 - update the "success" url pattern matching with a recent zoom change. Kudos to @aocole
